<h1>Mandelbrot Movie Maker</h1>
<p>
  This tool allows to explore the Mandelbrot set.
  Use the mouse to select a rectangular area to zoom into.
  After the selection is made, use the cursor keys for fine tuning and press the enter key to zoom in.
  The tool uses 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point for calculations, so zooming in will have limits.
  Each zoom step is added to the preview pane.
  The thumbnails are selectable, and when the delete key is pressed, the selected item and all to its right will be removed.
</p>

<h2>Generating a movie</h2>
<p>
  A movie of the different zoom steps can be saved as a MP4 video.
  When this action is chosen from the menu, the destination and the frame rate has to be specified.
  The number of frames per zoom step is defined at the start of the tool, together with the color gradient.
</p>

<h2>Saving individual frames</h2>
<p>
  The currently shown zoom step can be saved as a PNG image.
  Select this action from the menu. The saved image contains meta data
  describing the zoom step and can be loaded at the start of the tool as well.
